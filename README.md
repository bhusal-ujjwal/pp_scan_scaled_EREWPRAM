**Used C++ programming language and OpenMP C/C++ compiler's extension.**
1) EREW PRAM algorithm for parallel computation of prefix scan on array of integer values (https://github.com/bhusal-ujjwal/pp_scan_EREWPRAM)
2) scaled EREW PRAM algorithm for parallel computation of prefix scan on array of integer values
The content of the input array can be generated by the program as a sequence within the range 1 - N, where N is specified by the application's user.

**The application's user will be allowed to specify the size of the input array as well as the number of threads engaged in the calculation. 
Note that in the first algorithm, the number of the input values must be equal to the number of used threads.
while in the second algorithm, the number of used threads can be significantly lower than the number of the input values.**
